# Chat Application Using WebServices

In this Project, I have created a Chat application using WebServices. The application contain the
following things: 

- Sign in and Sign Up Screen
- A login Screen where a User can login and logout in the application.
- The application able to work properly when it is not connected with
the Internet. Like, it should shows old messages, and saved messages in the
offline mode. It also be able to send message when it gets internet
connection back.
- User be able to share pictures.
- Search button on the main Screen must search the Users in the Recycler
View, like shown in the picture below in WhatsApp Application.
- Search Bar filters the users on the basis of Username.
- Long tap hold should result in popup chat deletion.
